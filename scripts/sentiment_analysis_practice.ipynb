      "Summary:  Humira had to be discounted by over 80% overseas and a similar plight could occur in the US sooner than later. The stock has upside potential but considerable downside risk. Much depends on ramping up of drugs in the pipeline and FDA approvals for new drugs. From a valuation perspective, the stock has 24% upside to 17% downside and in our opinion, this isn't very compelling at the moment. Speculative investors may want to take a shot but conservative investors should sit this one out. \n",

An active emphasis is now placed on the expansion of technical development teams, capacity up by 20% leading to higher quality releases. Legacy management issues are being addressed competently and the return of previous CFO provides positive market sentiment.

Huge investments in e-vapor and cannabis are overshadowed by an uncertain regulatory climate. Altria is doing what is necessary to adapt to changing consumer habits. The company needs to make these investments to ensure its future growth. Due to the significant decline in the share price, Altria stock is a buying opportunity. \n",

Long Island City, Queens, will thus lose 25,000 jobs, with an average salary of at least $150,000, through carping at a deal that had already been signed, sealed and delivered. Amazon’s opponents assailed the firm’s greed, but it was their own hypocritical greed that chased a future of prosperity out of their domain. \n",

Dip in prices will drag Anadarko Petroleum’s earnings and cash flows, but it can still generate a profit and free cash flows (incl. dividends) if oil stays above $54/bbl. Beyond 2019, Anadarko Petroleum expects to further reduce its costs and begin working on the Mozambique LNG project. However, Anadarko Petroleum continues to carry a large debt load of $16.4 billion with a D/E ratio of 150% (136% as adj.), which is one of the highest in large-cap E&P space. \n",

      "Summary:  As predicted in my article, “Sonos: Long The Products - Short The Shares”, published ahead of the Sonos Q1-2019 earnings release, results for revenue and EPS surprised to the upside. Also, as predicted, the results confirmed Sonos is suffering from a continuing decline in gross margins that is proving intractable. Cutting sales and marketing expense is not a solution. Based on share volume since the end of Sonos’ 180 day IPO lock-up on January 28, many of Sonos’ pre-IPO investors, not subject Rule 144 restrictions, will have now exited. That leaves an overhang of ~51 million shares held by 5% investors, over half the float, free to sell following the earnings release, and undoubtedly looking for an early exit. \n",
